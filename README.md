CS147_TokenApp
==============

CS147 Group Project Application - Token


First time application built for my Human-Computer Interactio and Design class (CS147).
I served as the sole coding lead on this project and put in over 30 hours of work during
Thanksgiving Break and the week that followed to complete the project. Thankful for 
collaborators and design leads Bruno De Martino, Stephany Yong and Janet An who were of 
significant help along the way. We plan to continue this app iteration in the next segment 
of the class (CS147H), and I will try and keep this repository updated as work continues!
